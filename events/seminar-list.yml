  title: Novel methods for analysing single cell gene expression data
  abstract: >
   This talk will introduce three novel methods we developed to address key 
   challenges in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. <b>Sincast</b>
   is an imputation method that denoises scRNA-seq data to enhance the 
   robustness of downstream statistical analyses. Its utility is highlighted 
   through comprehensive benchmarking of cell identity against bulk 
   transcriptomic references. <b>StableMate</b> is a stability-focused regression 
   framework that identifies functional dependencies in gene expression that 
   are either conserved or meaningfully variable across biological contexts. 
   When applied to scRNA-seq data, StableMate enhances reproducibility and 
   provides regulatory insights into co-expression analyses. <b>NeighbourNet</b> 
   constructs cell-specific gene regulatory networks, facilitating the fine-grained 
   characterization of gene regulatory dynamics at the single-cell level and 
   offering a new perspective on analysing scRNA-seq through cellular variation 
   in co-expression.

   Yidi Deng is a statistical bioinformatician and new post-doctoral fellow, working with Dr Emi Tanaka to uncover genomic insights that support Australia’s grain-industry research. Yidi completed a PhD in applied statistics at the University of Melbourne, where he developed novel methods for multi-omics data integration and variable selection, aimed at deciphering gene-regulatory mechanisms in the context of developmental biology and immunology. Yidi’s overall research interests is to translate advanced statistical approaches into intuitive, practical software that biologists can easily adopt without specialized statistical or computational expertise.
