  title: How will future climate change affect wheat yield and nutritional quality?
  abstract: >
   In the coming decades, climate change will continue to bring higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations which lead to warmer air temperatures. However, the combined effects of elevated CO₂ (eCO2) and elevated temperature (eT) on wheat grain yield and nutrition quality remain largely unknown. When tested separately, eCO2 increases wheat yield and decreases grain nutritional quality, whereas eT decreases yield, with unknown effects on grain quality. 

   To better understand the combined treatment of eCO2 and eT on wheat performances under future climate conditions, this talk presents early insights into one of the largest experiments of its kind — testing 90 genetically diverse wheat lines under realistic climate conditions by the year 2100 (800 ppm CO2 and + 5°C). This talk presents preliminary results from the first year’s experiment. In this talk, both traditional biometrics and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) traits are used to explain the variations in plant responses to future climate conditions. As such, providing early understanding about the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to variations in wheat yield and nutrition qualities that can be studied further in future experiments.

   Zixiong is a second-year PhD student at the Research School of Biology (RSB). He is supervised by Professor Danielle Way where he focuses on plant physiological responses to future climate change in Australian spring wheat lines. Zixiong completed his Master’s degree with Professor Justin Borevitz at the Australian National University. During Zixiong’s Master’s degrees, he discovered genomic structural variants using population-level long-read sequencing on wild Eucalyptus pangenomes. He joined the Way Lab in 2023, transitioning his focus from population genomics to ecophysiology and plant phenomics.

  title: Novel methods for analysing single cell gene expression data
  abstract: >
   This talk will introduce three novel methods we developed to address key 
   challenges in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. <b>Sincast</b>
   is an imputation method that denoises scRNA-seq data to enhance the 
   robustness of downstream statistical analyses. Its utility is highlighted 
   through comprehensive benchmarking of cell identity against bulk 
   transcriptomic references. <b>StableMate</b> is a stability-focused regression 
   framework that identifies functional dependencies in gene expression that 
   are either conserved or meaningfully variable across biological contexts. 
   When applied to scRNA-seq data, StableMate enhances reproducibility and 
   provides regulatory insights into co-expression analyses. <b>NeighbourNet</b> 
   constructs cell-specific gene regulatory networks, facilitating the fine-grained 
   characterization of gene regulatory dynamics at the single-cell level and 
   offering a new perspective on analysing scRNA-seq through cellular variation 
   in co-expression.

   Yidi Deng is a statistical bioinformatician and new post-doctoral fellow, working with Dr Emi Tanaka to uncover genomic insights that support Australia’s grain-industry research. Yidi completed a PhD in applied statistics at the University of Melbourne, where he developed novel methods for multi-omics data integration and variable selection, aimed at deciphering gene-regulatory mechanisms in the context of developmental biology and immunology. Yidi’s overall research interests is to translate advanced statistical approaches into intuitive, practical software that biologists can easily adopt without specialized statistical or computational expertise.
