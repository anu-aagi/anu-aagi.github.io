## ANU Biometrics Seminar Series

The series aims to foster knowledge exchange at the intersection of biology, statistics, 
computing, and data science. We hope to use this as a regular platform for the community to share their work, spark meaningful discussions and cultivate interdisciplinary collaborations. To facilitate participation from across campus, the seminars will primarily be held online via Zoom. If you are interested in organising or joining a watch party, please get in touch.

If you would like to receive notice about the seminar, please complete the short form [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=XHJ941yrJEaa5fBTPkhkN8f_OhednjZDplTOe4g095JUMVdBV1JDRTVBMU9NNzZKNVY0STFaUkVWSSQlQCN0PWcu).
