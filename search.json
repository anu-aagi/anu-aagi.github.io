The complete analysis code by default should be open (not ‚Äúavailable by request‚Äù bullcrap) unless there is a good reason not to. Of course, some data may have sensitive information then you should not share this publicly and certainly should not be done without the permission of the data collector. In this instance, we encourage you to generate synthetic data so your code can be run on the synthetic data. Where the reason for not sharing data is due to having a competitive advantage, then we suggest to pre-define an embargo period."
