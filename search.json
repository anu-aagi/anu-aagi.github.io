    "title": "Visiting Boorowa Agricultural Research Station of CSIRO",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On September 9th, Patrick and I, two statisticians who usually only see the data but not ever seeing how they are born, finally had the chance to visit a real field experiment at the Boorowa Agricultural Research Station (BARS) of CSIRO. Many thanks to CSIRO for organizing the event and inviting our AAGI team (for free!). Both Patrick and I were thrilled before the visit. It felt like those school-organized spring excursions back in our high school days.\nWe left the ANU campus in the morning for the one-hour drive to BARS. The views turned spectacular as we approached the station. It was the first time for me seeing such a massive canola field stretching into the horizon, absolutely stunning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of canola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi~\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were welcomed with talks from Georgie, Stuart, Susie, Aswin, John, Greg, and Allison, who introduced the research capabilities and ongoing projects at BARS. I was amazed at how modern agricultural research has become. The farm has a comprehensive sensor network, fully digitized data and research management, and even drones scanning fields to phenotype biomass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction by Georgie Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBARS digital capabilities by Stuart Brown\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Susie Sprague presented her work on blackleg canola disease trials, which our AAGI team is also involved in. Patrick will be developing computer vision methods to identify diseased canola plants, while I will be working on sample size calculations for QTL analysis to identify loci associated with disease resistance. Canola is one of the major crops in the ACT, and blackleg is a severe fungal disease that evolves quickly, spreads rapidly, and easily develops fungicide resistance. Susie shared the story of a local farmer struggling with blackleg who turned to BARS for help. It’s such a boost of motivation for me of how research like this can directly impact people’s lives: glad I’m choosing the correct job haha.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSusie Sprague introducing blackleg disease\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDuring the lunch break, Patrick, being much more outgoing than me, introduced himself to Susie and kindly introduced me as well. Susie explained some of the challenges in QTL analysis for this project. The blakcleg resistance trait in canola is extremely variable. Environmental factors, treatments, genetics, and measurement error together only explain a small fraction of this variability. Even plants within the same plot can show vastly different resistance levels. It would be interesting to know why of course (epigenetics, perhaps?).\nWe toured the farm facilities in the afternoon and saw equipment that most people never see in their lives: seed dryers, grain cleaners, and huge agricultural machinery like seeders, harvesters, and sprayers that usually only see in movies or video games. You really can’t imagine their size until you see them up close. My aim is to get on them once in these two years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrone for 3D scanning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil and seed samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed dryer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWheat thresher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeder\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then visited several research trials. Dr. John Kirkegaard showed us his long-term trial using old-school agronomic (no chemical, pure crop management). Faba beans are intercropped and rotated with canola, improving soil quality by fixing nitrogen. Susie took us to her canola plots, where we saw what diseased plants actually look like. Even the tiniest leaf lesion can be an entry point for the fungus. Finally, Dr. Greg Rebetzke showed us his dwarf wheat trail, where they molecular interventing the gibberellic acid signaling pathway to promote dwarf wheat phenotypes to increase yield. Those plants are only 10–20 cm tall (normally they are aorund 1 meter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercropping faba beans with canola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusie showing us infected canola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg introducing dwarf wheat, but the cloud looks like a platypus\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, we headed back home tired but happy. Others in the car asked about who we were on the drive. It was definitely easier to explain once we mentioned BDSI and Emi. Hopefully one day BDSI will return! (it was quite funny how Tony forgot Patrick’s name for the third time)."

The development of statistical methods to model the genotype by environment interaction using environmental covariates (ECs) has mostly occurred within the context of crop breeding. In agronomic research, measuring the impact of management practice (M) on genotype performance is also a key objective, giving rise to the genotype by environment by management practice (G×E×M) interaction. A one-stage analysis approach, implemented in a linear mixed model framework, is presented, which incorporates ECs to disentangle the G×E×M interaction effects. The linear mixed model framework allows adjustments for design effects and spatial field trend, along with the estimation of heterogeneous residual variance across environments. An application of the methodology will be demonstrated using a series of sorghum agronomy field experiments. Recently, a complementary R-package called ecreml was developed to enable researchers to easily apply the developed statistical methodology to their own multi-environment trial data consisting of G×E×M interaction effects, and is publicly available to install via GitHub.\nBio:\nMichael is a biometrician at the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, with extensive experience collaborating with agricultural researchers on a range of Grain Research Development Corporation (GRDC) projects; initially through the Statistics for the Australian Grains Industry (SAGI) project and more recently the Analytics for the Australian Grain Industry (AAGI) initiative. Michael’s research interests are in statistical methodological development, with a focus on developing methodologies that are directly applicable to agricultural experiments. Michael is also completing PhD studies part-time currently through the University of Queensland, focused on developing improved statistical methodologies for the analysis of count data arising from comparative agricultural experiments using generalised linear mixed models.\n\n\nDesign and Spatial Analysis of On-Farm Strip Trials: From Principles to Simulation Evaluations Zhanglong Cao (Curtin University)\n\n\nShow Details\n\nThis study explores statistical strategies for the design and analysis of on-farm experiments (OFE), grounded in established principles of experimental design and spatial modelling. Through simulation studies, we assess various approaches, including design layouts combined with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for continuous response variables and Linear Mixed Models (LMM) for categorical treatments. Our results align with key findings in the literature, emphasising the importance of appropriate design and modelling choices for effectively capturing spatial heterogeneity. Additionally, we compare two trial types—large-strip trials and stacked replicated trials—and highlight the significance of data granularity, which informs data collection strategies for industry partners. The findings advocate for appropriate trial designs for different purpose, and increased within-trial sampling, rather than reliance solely on average values to better reflect local variability and enhance inference accuracy. This work underscores the critical role of tailored statistical methods in improving the reliability and practical applicability of OFE outcomes.\n\n\nHow will future climate change affect wheat yield and nutritional quality? Zixiong Zhuang (Australian National University)\n\n\nShow Details\n\nIn the coming decades, climate change will continue to bring higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations as well as warmer air temperatures. However, the combined effects of elevated CO₂ (eCO2) and elevated temperature (eT) on wheat grain yield and nutrition quality remain largely unknown. When tested separately, eCO2 increases wheat yield and decreases grain nutritional quality, whereas eT decreases yield but with unknown effects on grain quality. To better understand the concurrent treatment of eCO2 and eT on wheat performances as per realistic future climate conditions, this talk presents early insights into one of the largest experiments to expand our knowledge in this area — testing 90 genetically diverse wheat lines under projected climate conditions by the year 2100 (800 ppm CO2 and + 5°C). This talk presents preliminary results from the first year’s experiment of this project. I outline both the traditional biometrics and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) traits captured to explain the variations in plant responses to future climate conditions. I demonstrate analyses that support early understanding about the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to variations in wheat yield and nutrition qualities that can be studied further in future experiments.\nBio:\nZixiong is a second-year PhD student at the Research School of Biology (RSB). He is supervised by Professor Danielle Way where he focuses on plant physiological responses to future climate change in Australian spring wheat lines. Zixiong completed his Master’s degree with Professor Justin Borevitz at the Australian National University. During Zixiong’s Master’s degrees, he discovered genomic structural variants using population-level long-read sequencing on wild Eucalyptus pangenomes. He joined the Way Lab in 2023, transitioning his focus from population genomics to ecophysiology and plant phenomics.\n\n\nNovel methods for analysing single cell gene expression data Yidi Deng (Australian National University)\n\n\nShow Details\n\nThis talk will introduce three novel methods we developed to address key challenges in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Sincast is an imputation method that denoises scRNA-seq data to enhance the robustness of downstream statistical analyses. Its utility is highlighted through comprehensive benchmarking of cell identity against bulk transcriptomic references. StableMate is a stability-focused regression framework that identifies functional dependencies in gene expression that are either conserved or meaningfully variable across biological contexts. When applied to scRNA-seq data, StableMate enhances reproducibility and provides regulatory insights into co-expression analyses.

The development of statistical methods to model the genotype by environment interaction using environmental covariates (ECs) has mostly occurred within the context of crop breeding. In agronomic research, measuring the impact of management practice (M) on genotype performance is also a key objective, giving rise to the genotype by environment by management practice (G×E×M) interaction. A one-stage analysis approach, implemented in a linear mixed model framework, is presented, which incorporates ECs to disentangle the G×E×M interaction effects. The linear mixed model framework allows adjustments for design effects and spatial field trend, along with the estimation of heterogeneous residual variance across environments. An application of the methodology will be demonstrated using a series of sorghum agronomy field experiments. Recently, a complementary R-package called ecreml was developed to enable researchers to easily apply the developed statistical methodology to their own multi-environment trial data consisting of G×E×M interaction effects, and is publicly available to install via GitHub.\nBio:\nMichael is a biometrician at the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, with extensive experience collaborating with agricultural researchers on a range of Grain Research Development Corporation (GRDC) projects; initially through the Statistics for the Australian Grains Industry (SAGI) project and more recently the Analytics for the Australian Grain Industry (AAGI) initiative. Michael’s research interests are in statistical methodological development, with a focus on developing methodologies that are directly applicable to agricultural experiments. Michael is also completing PhD studies part-time currently through the University of Queensland, focused on developing improved statistical methodologies for the analysis of count data arising from comparative agricultural experiments using generalised linear mixed models.\n\n\nDesign and Spatial Analysis of On-Farm Strip Trials: From Principles to Simulation Evaluations Zhanglong Cao (Curtin University)\n\n\nShow Details\n\nThis study explores statistical strategies for the design and analysis of on-farm experiments (OFE), grounded in established principles of experimental design and spatial modelling. Through simulation studies, we assess various approaches, including design layouts combined with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for continuous response variables and Linear Mixed Models (LMM) for categorical treatments. Our results align with key findings in the literature, emphasising the importance of appropriate design and modelling choices for effectively capturing spatial heterogeneity. Additionally, we compare two trial types—large-strip trials and stacked replicated trials—and highlight the significance of data granularity, which informs data collection strategies for industry partners. The findings advocate for appropriate trial designs for different purpose, and increased within-trial sampling, rather than reliance solely on average values to better reflect local variability and enhance inference accuracy. This work underscores the critical role of tailored statistical methods in improving the reliability and practical applicability of OFE outcomes.\n\n\nHow will future climate change affect wheat yield and nutritional quality? Zixiong Zhuang (Australian National University)\n\n\nShow Details\n\nIn the coming decades, climate change will continue to bring higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations as well as warmer air temperatures. However, the combined effects of elevated CO₂ (eCO2) and elevated temperature (eT) on wheat grain yield and nutrition quality remain largely unknown. When tested separately, eCO2 increases wheat yield and decreases grain nutritional quality, whereas eT decreases yield but with unknown effects on grain quality. To better understand the concurrent treatment of eCO2 and eT on wheat performances as per realistic future climate conditions, this talk presents early insights into one of the largest experiments to expand our knowledge in this area — testing 90 genetically diverse wheat lines under projected climate conditions by the year 2100 (800 ppm CO2 and + 5°C). This talk presents preliminary results from the first year’s experiment of this project. I outline both the traditional biometrics and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) traits captured to explain the variations in plant responses to future climate conditions. I demonstrate analyses that support early understanding about the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to variations in wheat yield and nutrition qualities that can be studied further in future experiments.\nBio:\nZixiong is a second-year PhD student at the Research School of Biology (RSB). He is supervised by Professor Danielle Way where he focuses on plant physiological responses to future climate change in Australian spring wheat lines. Zixiong completed his Master’s degree with Professor Justin Borevitz at the Australian National University. During Zixiong’s Master’s degrees, he discovered genomic structural variants using population-level long-read sequencing on wild Eucalyptus pangenomes. He joined the Way Lab in 2023, transitioning his focus from population genomics to ecophysiology and plant phenomics.\n\n\nNovel methods for analysing single cell gene expression data Yidi Deng (Australian National University)\n\n\nShow Details\n\nThis talk will introduce three novel methods we developed to address key challenges in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Sincast is an imputation method that denoises scRNA-seq data to enhance the robustness of downstream statistical analyses. Its utility is highlighted through comprehensive benchmarking of cell identity against bulk transcriptomic references. StableMate is a stability-focused regression framework that identifies functional dependencies in gene expression that are either conserved or meaningfully variable across biological contexts. When applied to scRNA-seq data, StableMate enhances reproducibility and provides regulatory insights into co-expression analyses. NeighbourNet constructs cell-specific gene regulatory networks, facilitating the fine-grained characterization of gene regulatory dynamics at the single-cell level and offering a new perspective on analysing scRNA-seq through cellular variation in co-expression.\nBio:\nYidi Deng is a statistical bioinformatician and new post-doctoral fellow, working with Dr Emi Tanaka to uncover genomic insights that support Australia’s grain-industry research.
