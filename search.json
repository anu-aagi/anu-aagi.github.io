She is generally responsive and typically responds within 1-2 working day (if it takes longer than that, she may genuinely have missed/misplaced your email so just try again). If you feel uncomfortable talking to Emi Tanaka, you can talk to another faculty staff member (Emi‚Äôs go-to person is Alan Welsh) or Jo Bayley, if they are available and willing.\nNaturally, with more people involved, conflicts are inevitable. Conflicts are not necessary bad (in fact, can be a source of innovation and creativity), but it‚Äôs important to resolve it. We encourage you to talk to the person directly face-to-face (rather than having an emotionally charged email/text message exchanges) if you have a concern. If you feel uncomfortable doing so, you can talk to Emi Tanaka to mediate the conversation. In general, focus on what you can control rather than things you can‚Äôt."
