However, the combined effects of elevated CO‚ÇÇ (eCO2) and elevated temperature (eT) on wheat grain yield and nutrition quality remain largely unknown. When tested separately, eCO2 increases wheat yield and decreases grain nutritional quality, whereas eT decreases yield but with unknown effects on grain quality.\nTo better understand the concurrent treatment of eCO2 and eT on wheat performances as per realistic future climate conditions, this talk presents early insights into one of the largest experiments to expand our knowledge in this area ‚Äî testing 90 genetically diverse wheat lines under projected climate conditions by the year 2100 (800 ppm CO2 and + 5¬∞C). This talk presents preliminary results from the first year‚Äôs experiment of this project. I outline both the traditional biometrics and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) traits captured to explain the variations in plant responses to future climate conditions. I demonstrate analyses that support early understanding about the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to variations in wheat yield and nutrition qualities that can be studied further in future experiments.  \n\nBio\nZixiong is a second-year PhD student at the Research School of Biology (RSB). He is supervised by Professor Danielle Way where he focuses on plant physiological responses to future climate change in Australian spring wheat lines. Zixiong completed his Master‚Äôs degree with Professor Justin Borevitz at the Australian National University. During Zixiong‚Äôs Master‚Äôs degrees, he discovered genomic structural variants using population-level long-read sequencing on wild Eucalyptus pangenomes. He joined the Way Lab in 2023, transitioning his focus from population genomics to ecophysiology and plant phenomics.\n\n\n\n\n\nNovel methods for analysing single cell gene expression data\nYidi Deng (Australian National University)\n\n\nThis talk will introduce three novel methods we developed to address key  challenges in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Sincast is an imputation method that denoises scRNA-seq data to enhance the  robustness of downstream statistical analyses. Its utility is highlighted  through comprehensive benchmarking of cell identity against bulk  transcriptomic references. StableMate is a stability-focused regression  framework that identifies functional dependencies in gene expression that  are either conserved or meaningfully variable across biological contexts.  When applied to scRNA-seq data, StableMate enhances reproducibility and  provides regulatory insights into co-expression analyses. NeighbourNet  constructs cell-specific gene regulatory networks, facilitating the fine-grained  characterization of gene regulatory dynamics at the single-cell level and  offering a new perspective on analysing scRNA-seq through cellular variation  in co-expression.\n\nBio\nYidi Deng is a statistical bioinformatician and new post-doctoral fellow, working with Dr Emi Tanaka to uncover genomic insights that support Australia‚Äôs grain-industry research. Yidi completed a PhD in applied statistics at the University of Melbourne, where he developed novel methods for multi-omics data integration and variable selection, aimed at deciphering gene-regulatory mechanisms in the context of developmental biology and immunology.
