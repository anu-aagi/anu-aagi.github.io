We're pleased to welcome the last of the 3 postdocs hired this year, Yidi Deng, to the team! Yidi will be working in the area of bioinformatics and integration of molecular phenotypes.

Yidi has an impressive list of work from his PhD working in developing and applying statistical methods for single cell data integration analysis. His work from his PhD include:

- Sincast - a computational framework to query scRNA-seq data (SIN) by projecting onto bulk reference atlases [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](<https://github.com/meiosis97/Sincast)
- StableMate - a variable selection for multi-environmental regression [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/meiosis97/StableMate)
- NeighbourNet - predict gene regulatory network for individual cells in single cell RNA-seq data [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/meiosis97/NeighbourNet)
- Application to human inner ear macrophage [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/meiosis97/Inner-ear-macrophage)

We are looking forward to learning more about his work and working with him ðŸ˜„
