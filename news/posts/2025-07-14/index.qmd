Now that all three postdocs we hired have arrived, we sprinted with 4 training sessions in the past week. In our training sessions we covered contents like:

- the analysis of a single field trial,
- the analysis of a multi-environmental field trial,
- workflow and tools for reporting (including how we structure our projects and name things!), and
- linear mixed models.

Thank you to [Fonti](https://fontikar.github.io/) for showcasing about project structure and tools for project management! A happy coincidence meant we got to celebrate Fonti's birthday with a cake in our last training session ðŸ˜Š

And in case if you were wondering, we did do the training! Lots of great discussions and what a load of fun learning different perspectives.

All our training materials is available [here](https://anu-aagi.github.io/education) and we look forward to developing and accumulating more materials for the community!
