I had the pleasure of visiting and presenting to the [Lab of Biometry and Bioinformatics](https://www.ut-biomet.org/home-english) at the Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Science, University of Tokyo üéå. Thank you to [Gota](http://morotalab.org/) for being a wonderful host and taking us (myself and Francis) to eat some delicious Japanese food üç≤ 

I also thoroughly enjoyed listening to the student presentations, which showcased 
impressive research of analytical methods to draw insight from multiomics crop data. In particular, learning about the lab‚Äôs multiomics soybean dataset left me both inspired and a little envious‚ÄîI would love the opportunity to analyse such a rich source of data myself! I was also impressed with [Hayato](https://sites.google.com/view/hayato-john-yoshioka/home?authuser=0), a soon to finish PhD student, who developed the [`rrda`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrda/index.html) R package as part of his research. Thank you again to everyone in the lab for a warm welcome and stimulating scientific exchange.

The food in Japan is incredibly delicious, and I‚Äôm amazed at how much more 
affordable it is compared to Australia (often about half the price)! The quality of 
vegetables and fruits on display in supermarkets is also outstanding. With so many 
tempting options, I have to admit, I‚Äôm definitely indulging a bit too much!

It‚Äôs been seven years since my last visit to Japan, and experiencing small 
moments like catching a glimpse of Tokyo Tower or stumbling upon a tiny roadside 
jinja continually reminds me of the Japanese culture. I'm looking forward to visiting again and hopefully more regularly!
