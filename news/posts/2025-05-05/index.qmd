We are excited to welcome Patrick Li, who will be working in the area of image analytics, machine learning and phenotyping methods.

Patrick, who moved from Melbourne, has developed computer vision models for automating reading of residual plots, implemented as the R package `autovi`. He also created the `spotoroo` R package, an 
algorithm designed to cluster satellite hot spot spatio-temporal data. His work on `spotoroo` earned him a software award.
