On 15th August 2025, Zixiong Zhuang (a PhD student at Danielle Way's lab) presented to us about his glasshouse pre-breeding wheat experiment and its analysis from the first year data. His experiment is important in understanding how future production and nutrition of wheat would be like with the onset of climate change (increased temperature and increased CO<sub>2</sub>). Soon after this talk, we were priviledged to have a glasshouse tour to see his experiment.

 The future climate conditions tend to hasten the wheat growth. You can see this in the photos below.

Thank you to Zixiong for the tour and looking forward to seeing more about this year's data!
